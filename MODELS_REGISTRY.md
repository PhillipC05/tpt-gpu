# TPT Shared Model Registry

All tools in the TPT compute suite (tpt-gpu, tpt-spark, tpt-crucible) share a
single GGUF model directory so that models are downloaded once and never
duplicated.

---

## Canonical location

```
~/.tpt/models/
├── models.json          # manifest (see schema below)
├── llama-3-8b-q4.gguf
├── mistral-7b-q4.gguf
└── ...
```

On Windows the home directory is `%USERPROFILE%`, so the full path is
`%USERPROFILE%\.tpt\models\`.

---

## Manifest format — `models.json`

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "models": [
    {
      "name":     "llama-3-8b-q4",
      "file":     "llama-3-8b-q4.gguf",
      "arch":     "llama3",
      "size_gb":  4.7,
      "sha256":   "abc123...",
      "source":   "https://huggingface.co/..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Field definitions

| Field     | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `name`    | yes      | Human-readable, URL-safe identifier (used as lookup key) |
| `file`    | yes      | Filename relative to `~/.tpt/models/` |
| `arch`    | yes      | Model architecture tag: `llama3`, `mistral`, `phi3`, `gemma2`, etc. |
| `size_gb` | yes      | Approximate on-disk size in GiB |
| `sha256`  | no       | SHA-256 of the GGUF file for integrity verification |
| `source`  | no       | Original download URL |

## Tool responsibilities

### tpt-gpu (this repo)

- Provides the `tpt-model-registry` crate (`tools/model-registry/`) with:
  - `ModelRegistry::open()` — loads or creates `~/.tpt/models/models.json`
  - `ModelRegistry::register()` — adds or updates a model entry
  - `ModelRegistry::find_by_name()` — looks up a model
  - `ModelRegistry::download()` — downloads a GGUF from a URL and registers it
- The HuggingFace download helper (`tools/model-registry/src/hf.rs`) writes
  directly into `~/.tpt/models/` and updates the manifest on success.

### tpt-spark

- Reads `~/.tpt/models/models.json` to discover available models instead of
  maintaining its own directory.
- Passes the resolved `file` path to its `WgpuEngine` or `TptGpuEngine`.

### tpt-crucible

- Catalyst ingestion reads GGUF files from `~/.tpt/models/` using the manifest
  as the source of truth for architecture and quantisation metadata.

## Versioning

The manifest `version` field is currently `"1"`. A breaking change to the
manifest schema will increment this number. Tools should refuse to parse
manifests with an unrecognised version and prompt the user to update.
